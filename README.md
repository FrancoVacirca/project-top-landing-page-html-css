Alrighty then this is my second project, "Project: Landing Page".

I have to mention (if you haven't noticed yet), this website is heavily inspired in (https://criosyom.github.io/Hakurei_Shrine/) website about touhou, if you haven't saw it go and check it out.

i'm gonna be honest, somethings are pretty much almost the same as Criosyom's page but for the most time i tried to do all by myself, only times where i felt very lost i draw upon Criosyom's project, IA and Google.

it took me a week or so to finish this one, i have no past experience before TOP i just done a couple FreeCodeCamp excercises but not more than that.
While doing the project i was realizing how much i could have optimized the code and you'll notice a lot of  that, besides that i'm very happy with my work :)

For creator demands or trouble with copyright talk to me on discord (Dex#5424) and notice me if i'm breaking some rules or something, thank you.
